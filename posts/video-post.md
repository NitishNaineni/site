Video has become one of the most powerful mediums for communication on the web. The key is to ensure the video is responsive, meaning it looks great on any device.

By wrapping the standard video embed in a special container, we can maintain its aspect ratio without breaking the layout of our site.

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njX2bu-_Vw4?si=QgsGaJGM17u-XsK4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
