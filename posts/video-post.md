Video has become one of the most powerful mediums for communication on the web. Whether for tutorials, showcases, or storytelling, embedding video directly into your posts is a great way to engage your audience.

The key is to ensure the video is responsive, meaning it looks great on any device, from a large desktop monitor to a small mobile phone. By wrapping the standard video embed in a special container, we can maintain its aspect ratio without breaking the layout of our site.

Below is an example of a cleanly embedded, responsive video player.

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXb3EKWsInQ"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

This technique works for videos hosted on services like YouTube, Vimeo, and many others. It's a simple and robust way to make your content more dynamic and visually interesting.
