A modern blog needs more than just text. Hereâ€™s how we can embed various types of media.

### Images

Embedding an image is straightforward. As long as the image is in our `img` folder, we can reference it directly.

### Code Blocks

Displaying code is essential. Notice the use of `inline code` within this sentence.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  // Use a template literal to construct the greeting
  const message = `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the website.`;
  console.log(message);
}

greet('Nitish');
