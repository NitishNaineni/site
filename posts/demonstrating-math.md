This is the content of my very first blog post. Eleventy makes it incredibly easy to get started with a new blog. You can write your content here using Markdown, and it will be automatically converted to HTML.

For example, you can write an **inline equation** like the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, right in the middle of a sentence.

For more complex or important equations, you can use a **block display**, like the Quadratic Formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
